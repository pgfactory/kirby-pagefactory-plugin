# Congratulations!

You successfully installed **Kirby CMS** and **PageFactory** plugin.

To modify this page, edit the file ``site/home/home.md``.

{{ vgap( 2em ) }}

Then, to add additional pages and administer your new website in general, 

&rarr; open the [Panel](./panel/)

Have fun!

{{ vgap( 2em ) }}

**Please Note:**

PageFactory deviates somewhat from Kirby's way of working with templates.  
Thus, if you are well familiar with Kirby, note that -- for the sake of usability --  
PageFactory takes a slightly different approach to templating.
