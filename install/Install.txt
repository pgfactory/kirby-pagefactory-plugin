Installation of Kirby/Pagefactory
=================================

 Starting Point
---------------
- This assumes you are working in a linux/unix environment.
- Further, it assumes that you will install PageFactory in a subfolder of doc-root.
- In other cases you'll need to slightly adapt the installation process.
- Apache2, git and composer must be available on your system.

If you are working on a Windows computer, see comments towards the end of this file.
